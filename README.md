# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview

The Colorado Board of Elections has given us the task of collecting and analyzing a series of data that will help them determine the outcome of the elections, the tasks to be carried out are the follow
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a acomplete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.11.0, Visual Studio Code, 1.73.1

 ## Challenge Overview
 
In this challenge we were able to find precise results of the elections in Colorado where we defined a winner through coding and supported by tools such as python and visual code studio, where we followed an ordered format, which can be seen below:

## Analysis

After applying our code the result was the following:

Based on these results we can define the following:
 - Total votes were 369,711
 - The counties that were part of the voting were: Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe.
 - Denver was the decisive county, with 306,055 voters representing 82.8% of the total votes
 - Diana DeGette was the winner of the elections with 272,892 votes, which represents 73.8% of the total

### Conclution

Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that in the next elections the candidates should focus on winning votes and putting more effort into their political campaign in Denver County.
 
## Election Audit Summary

The previous script shows us how we can manage to summarize a large series of data that without the appropriate tools it would be simply impossible to achieve accurate and reliable results, the previous script can be used with some modifications to have information such as voter variation during each election period; if there are more or fewer voters each time; another example may be population growth, statistics on voters such as gender and age ranges.
